Bridging open-source and start-ups with smarter freelance contracts

Get a Lawyer
------------

This agreement isn't legal advice, and contributors to this agreement aren't your lawyers. The agreement is like a demo: It meets one particular set of needs using one particular framework. Your needs are probably different. The framework may be plain wrong for your deal.

Get a lawyer, exercise, and eat your vegetables.

About the Agreement
-------------------

The Agreement aims to be fair to developers and clients. It acknowledges the need the enlightened self-interest that makes the open-source community possible and the grizzled self-interest that makes Bay Area technology companies possible.

The Agreement believes:

- Permissively licensed software is compatible with the start-up model
- A richer software commons benefits all.
- Software made of small, modular components is better software.
