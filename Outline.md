West-Span Software Development Agreement
========================================

Intellectual Property
---------------------

### Third-Party Materials

- The Developer is explicitly permitted to use third-party free and open source tools and platforms, including reciprocally licensed tools.

- The developer cannot link to, modify, or otherwise derive new works from reciprocally licensed work.

- The Developer explicitly may link to, modify, and derivate new works from third-party packages licensed under enumerated academic open-source licenses.

### The Deliverable

- The final deliverable comprises assets, the top-level project, and various original, Client-provided, and third-party packages.

  - Packages comprise general source code that is organized in a language- and tool-specific way for redistribution to provide a specific piece of general functionality that is not specific to the project. Packages comprise the files found in a specific package directory within the final delivery archive.

  - Assets include graphic media, text, sound, video, templates, configuration files, and other non-package components.

  - The top-level project is the assembly of packages and assets that meets the goals of the project.

- Upon delivery, Developer must provide a schedule of packages used in the deliverable laying out the name, author, description, license, and contract-defined license category for each package, including original packages.

### Copyright

- IP ownership is "inverted". (Thanks, @mikeal) The Developer retains copyright in each original asset and module comprising the final deliverable.

- The Developer grants an exclusive license to the Client, subject to an option to release modules under one of the permissive licenses approved for open-source work used in the project with prior notice to the Client. (Thanks, @hughsk)

- The contract explicitly disclaims any obligation on the part of the Developer to maintain or improve modules published open-source. (Thanks, @substack)

- The Client may buy out the Developer's right to publish modules open-source by an additional payment, a portion of the total contract price in proportion to the number of modules "bought out", within a given number of days after final delivery. (Thanks, @substack)

### Patent Rights

- The Developer makes a present assignment of all patent rights to the Client.

- The Client grants Developer a license to inventions:

  - to the extent they would otherwise infringe inventions embodied in a module that is later published open-source

  - to grant free-of-charge, non-exclusive sublicenses to third parties for claims of patents embodied in any package later published open-source, to the extent necessarily infringed by use of that package (Thanks, @twitter, by way of the Innovators Patent Agreement)

### Trade Secrets

Work
----

### Iterations

- Work proceeds in a series of iterations. (Thanks, Chris Kim)

- The first iteration comprises consultation between Client and Developer to better understand the client needs and develop a roadmap for the project.

- The second iteration comprises configuration of the infrastructure, including version control, integration, and deployment, necessary for future iterations.

- During subsequent iterations:

  - Developer sends Client a written summary of the most recent conversation about the goals for the next development iteration.

  - Client confirms the written summary.

  - Developer delivers updated work product for Client review.

  - Developer and Client review the new and improved state of the project together.

  - Client either accepts that the improved delivery meets the goals for that iteration and accepts it, or specifies how the work product falls short, without adding to or embellishing the goals.

- The agreement does not take a position on the specific development methodology to be used. It only requires some delivery and communication between Client and Developer.

### Process

- Developer is required to track source code in a version control system. Developer may not rewrite history after the end of the iteration in which it is created.
